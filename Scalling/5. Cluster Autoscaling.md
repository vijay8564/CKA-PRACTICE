# 5. Cluster Autoscaling
* In addition to scaling the applications themselves, you can scale the underlying Kubernetes nodes using Cluster Autoscaler.
*  The Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster depending on resource utilization, so your applications have enough resources to scale.

* You can enable the Cluster Autoscaler in your cloud provider's Kubernetes setup (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP).
