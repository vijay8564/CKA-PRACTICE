# 1. Scaling the Number of Replicas (Horizontally)
* One of the simplest ways to scale an application in Kubernetes is by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas for your application.
*  You can scale the number of replicas manually or automatically based on resource usage.

* **Manually Scale with kubectl**
* You can scale the number of replicas of a deployment using the kubectl scale command:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
```
* This command will set the number of replicas for the my-app deployment to 5. You can replace my-app with your own deployment name and adjust the replica count.

* **Example: Scale Using YAML**
* Alternatively, you can specify the replica count in the deployment YAML file and apply the changes.

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-app-image
```
* Apply the changes using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
* This will scale your deployment to 5 replicas.
