# Summary of Scaling Methods:
* `Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Pods)`: Increase or decrease the number of replicas of a deployment using kubectl scale or YAML definitions.
* `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)`: Automatically scale the number of replicas based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
* `Vertical Scaling (Scaling Resources)`: Adjust CPU and memory requests/limits for individual pods.
* `Cluster Autoscaler`: Scale the number of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to match resource demands.
* Choose the scaling method based on your application's requirements and how you want to manage resources in your Kubernetes cluster.
