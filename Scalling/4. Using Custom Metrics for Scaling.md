# 4. Using Custom Metrics for Scaling

* If you want to scale your application based on custom metrics (like queue length, request rate, etc.), you can configure HPA with custom metrics.
*  You will need to set up a custom metrics server, which can expose the metrics.

* **For example, you can create an HPA based on a custom metric like HTTP request rate:**

```bash
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: External
    external:
      metric:
        name: http_requests_per_second
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: my-app
      target:
        type: Value
        value: "100"
```
