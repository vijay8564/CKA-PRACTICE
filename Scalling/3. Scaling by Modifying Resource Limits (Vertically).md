# 3. Scaling by Modifying Resource Limits (Vertically)
* If you want to scale the resources allocated to each pod (e.g., CPU or memory), you can adjust the resource limits and requests for your containers.
*  This is known as vertical scaling.

* **Example: Update Deployment Resource Requests and Limits**
* Hereâ€™s how you can define resource requests and limits in the deployment YAML:
```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-app-image
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
            limits:
              memory: "1Gi"
              cpu: "1000m"
```

* `requests`: Specifies the amount of CPU and memory the container is guaranteed to have.
* `limits`: Specifies the maximum CPU and memory the container can use.

* To apply the changes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
